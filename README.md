# chatgpt_Episteme_1D_Toy_Ecosystem.ipynb
Been working on a scientific idea with ai agents,Chat GPT; Minimal Colab-ready simulation of the Episteme Spacecraft Project. Models DNA as data, algorithm, and operating system in a 1D toy ecosystem. Includes calibration, evolutionary dynamics, and resource scheduling. A science loop exploring how genomes internalize space, order, and temporality.

# Episteme Spacecraft Project – 1D Toy Ecosystem

This repository contains a **Colab-ready notebook** that implements a minimal, self-contained simulation of the **Episteme Spacecraft Project**.  

The project explores DNA as:
1. **Data** – genomes as encodings of morphology and adaptation  
2. **Algorithm** – evolutionary learning of space and temporality  
3. **Operating System** – scheduling biological processes under environmental constraints  

## Contents
- `Episteme_1D_Toy_Ecosystem.ipynb` – a single-file notebook runnable on Google Colab.  

## Features
- Toy **1D ecosystem** where genomes control simple organism parameters  
- Calibration loop mapping DNA sequences → traits  
- Evolutionary dynamics with internalization metric (mutual info proxy)  
- Resource scheduling loop mimicking OS-style process management  
- Simple plots of adaptation and stability  

## Usage
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Upload `Episteme_1D_Toy_Ecosystem.ipynb`.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce experiments 1–3.
